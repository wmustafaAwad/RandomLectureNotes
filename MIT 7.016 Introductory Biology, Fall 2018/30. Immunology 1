Immunity: resistance to disease based on prior exposure

Vaccines (first time found cowpox -> smallpox)

Two levels of immunity:
i) Innate immunity:
-- inborn
-- immediate
-- does not change with prior exposure
-- less specific

ii) adaptive immunity:
-- highly specific (that's why you get a shot for each variant)
-- acquired
-- delayed
a) humoral immunity (protein mediated, antibodies. Antibodies can be secreted into the blood)
B-Cells make antibodies (T-Cells mature in the bone marrow and B stands for bone marrow)
b) Cell-mediated (by T-Cells, that mature in the Thymus). 

Both a and b have antigen receptors (i.e recognize specific antigens). Antigens are 
things that result in an immune response. Could be: Proteins

-----
Each of a and b have their own type of antigen receptors:

a) B-Cell antigen receptors = immuniglobulins = antibodies
-- laterally symmetric  (one side is identical to the other)
-- heavy chains (long parts) and light chains (short parts)
