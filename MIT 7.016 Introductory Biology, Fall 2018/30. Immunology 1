Immunity: resistance to disease based on prior exposure

Vaccines (first time found cowpox -> smallpox)

Two levels of immunity:
i) Innate immunity:
-- inborn
-- immediate
-- does not change with prior exposure
-- less specific

ii) adaptive immunity:
-- highly specific (that's why you get a shot for each variant)
-- acquired
-- delayed
a) humoral immunity (protein mediated, antibodies. Antibodies can be secreted into the blood)
B-Cells make antibodies (T-Cells mature in the bone marrow and B stands for bone marrow)
b) Cell-mediated (by T-Cells, that mature in the Thymus). 

Both a and b have antigen receptors (i.e recognize specific antigens). Antigens are 
things that result in an immune response. Could be: Proteins

-----
Each of a and b have their own type of antigen receptors:

a) B-Cell antigen receptors = immuniglobulins (Ig) = antibodies (Ab)
-- laterally symmetric  (one side is identical to the other)
-- heavy chains (long parts) and light chains (short parts)
Either:
---- Membrane bound IgM
---- Secreted IgG
-- A specific anntibody is very specific, but they B-Cells can produce antibodies
that recognize a large range of molecules: small molecules, proteins, DNA, lipids,
carbohydrates ..etc

b) T-Cell receptor = TCR
-- Alpha and Beta chains recognize the antigen
-- Membrane bound only 
-- More restricted: will recognize peptides/short sequences of amino acids only,
presented by the MHC complex (class 1 and 2.. to be seen later).

Vh: Variable domain of //h//eavy chain. (Ch: constant domain of heavy chain) 
Vl: Variable domain of //l//ight chain. (Cl: constaint domain of light chain)

Properties of immune systems:

1) Specificity:
-- Differentiate between similar molecules
-- In the Vh/Vl, there are hyper-variable regions (also called complementarity determining regions,
CDRs for short) and there are 3 of them (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3). These regions are 
determined from aligned sequenes. They extend like fingers.
Even small differences in amino acid sequences result in large chanes in the affinity
of this antibody for an antigen.
-- Each B-Cell expresses 1 Ab -> And this Ab has unique specificty to an antigen.
But this means that we need to have lots of different B-Cells (one for each antigen).
This brings us to diversity.

2) Diversity:
-- How is it  generated?
