Immunity: resistance to disease based on prior exposure

Vaccines (first time found cowpox -> smallpox)

Two levels of immunity:
i) Innate immunity:
-- inborn
-- immediate
-- does not change with prior exposure
-- less specific

ii) adaptive immunity:
-- highly specific (that's why you get a shot for each variant)
-- acquired
-- delayed
a) humoral immunity (protein mediated, antibodies. Antibodies can be secreted into the blood)
B-Cells make antibodies (T-Cells mature in the bone marrow and B stands for bone marrow)
b) Cell-mediated (by T-Cells, that mature in the Thymus). 

Both a and b have antigen receptors (i.e recognize specific antigens). Antigens are 
things that result in an immune response. Could be: Proteins

-----
Each of a and b have their own type of antigen receptors:

a) B-Cell antigen receptors = immuniglobulins (Ig) = antibodies (Ab)
-- laterally symmetric  (one side is identical to the other)
-- heavy chains (long parts) and light chains (short parts)
Either:
---- Membrane bound IgM
---- Secreted IgG
-- A specific anntibody is very specific, but they B-Cells can produce antibodies
that recognize a large range of molecules: small molecules, proteins, DNA, lipids,
carbohydrates ..etc

b) T-Cell receptor = TCR
-- Alpha and Beta chains recognize the antigen
-- Membrane bound only 
-- More restricted: will recognize peptides/short sequences of amino acids only,
presented by the MHC complex (class 1 and 2.. to be seen later).

Vh: Variable domain of //h//eavy chain. (Ch: constant domain of heavy chain) 
Vl: Variable domain of //l//ight chain. (Cl: constaint domain of light chain)

Properties of immune systems:

1) Specificity:
-- Differentiate between similar molecules
-- In the Vh/Vl, there are hyper-variable regions (also called complementarity determining regions,
CDRs for short) and there are 3 of them (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3). These regions are 
determined from aligned sequenes. They extend like fingers.
Even small differences in amino acid sequences result in large chanes in the affinity
of this antibody for an antigen.
-- Each B-Cell expresses 1 Ab -> And this Ab has unique specificty to an antigen.
But this means that we need to have lots of different B-Cells (one for each antigen).
This brings us to diversity.

2) Diversity:
-- How is it  generated?  We have only 30K Ab genes, but millions of B cells.
Somatic Recombination generates diversity of molecules with unique specificity.
We have a single heavy chain gene, and two light chain genes; but they are 
composed of multiple gene segments, which are shuffled to generate this diversity.
-- The different blocks: V (variable region), D (Diverse region), J (joining region).
Light chain: V and J
Heavy chain: V, D, J
-- This shufflig is mediated by recombination at heavy and light chain genes. As opposed
to recombination during meiosis, which happens between homologous chromosomes, this
brings together and deletes sequences in the same chromosome. Process is known
as VDJ recombination, and it is lymphocyte-specific. 
-- Nucleotides can be inserted or deleted during the shuffling (i.e. during the
VDJ recombination). This imprecision is responsible for increasing diversity in addition
to shuffling. This change has to be a multiple of 3.
-- (T-Cell only) As a consequence of activating the T-cell reponse, there is sth known as somatic
hypermutation, which further increases the diversity. (aka affinity naturation)
-- Until this recombination happens, the responsible genes are not expressed.
-- Allelic exclusion makes
